# FuzzySysmon
My sysmon config I use for testing purposes. 

This sysmon was put together based on several other known and popular sysmon configs along with some of my own ideas on a config. I wouldn't reccomend this config in a production environment as this is more setup for my own threat hunting ideas and testing.
